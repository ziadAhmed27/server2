Let me paint you a picture.

You’re in ancient Egypt.
You’re walking through Karnak Temple, minding your business…
And then — boom — you see it.
A single piece of red granite, 30 meters tall, weighing over 300 tons, pointing at the sky like it’s trying to DM the sun god Ra.

That, my friend, is the Obelisk of Hatshepsut.

Not just a monument.
A power move.
A political statement.
A rock-solid mic drop from the most iconic woman in ancient Egyptian history.

Let’s rewind.

Hatshepsut — daughter of Thutmose I. Wife of Thutmose II. Step-mother of Thutmose III.
Basically, she inherited the whole Thutmose franchise.
But instead of just sitting on the throne as “Queen Regent,” she said:
“Nope. I’m Pharaoh now.”
And the gods? They’re cool with it.

Now, how do you prove to an entire kingdom that you’re not just allowed to rule — you were born to rule?

You build the tallest obelisk Egypt had ever seen.
And you do it in seven months.
Yes.
That’s not a typo. Seven. Months.

Modern humans struggle to assemble IKEA furniture in that time — Hatshepsut carved a skyscraper out of solid granite.

How?

First: they quarried the granite from Aswan — 200 kilometers south.
Then they had to transport a 300-ton block down the Nile using wooden barges and river engineering so good it would make civil engineers cry.
Then they stood it up vertically without cranes, steel, or Red Bull.

The obelisk was placed at the Karnak Temple — the largest religious complex in the ancient world.
Why there?
Because Karnak was the main stage for worshipping Amun-Ra — the chief god.
And Hatshepsut wanted to make sure that Amun knew:
“She didn’t come to play. She came to shine.”

And she says that… literally.
In the inscription carved into the base of the obelisk, she says:

“It is made to pierce the sky with its point.
Its rays flood the temple in gold…
like the sun itself.”

Translation:
“Yo, Amun. I made this for you. You’re welcome.”

Also, small detail:
She made two obelisks.
One still stands — the tallest surviving ancient obelisk in Egypt.
The other? It cracked during construction.
Instead of crying, she left it in the quarry, unfinished, as a backup episode of history.
That’s now the famous Unfinished Obelisk of Aswan — and it’s still lying there today, just vibing.

But like all things Hatshepsut, her legacy didn’t go unchallenged.

After she died, her stepson Thutmose III tried to erase her name from history — defaced her statues, removed her cartouches, and even built a wall around the obelisk to hide it.
Yes. He literally built a fence around a 30-meter stone just to pretend it wasn’t there.

Spoiler: it’s still there.
And she’s still shining.

So next time you doubt whether a woman in ancient times could rule like a king…
remember Hatshepsut.
She ruled, she reformed, she built —
And then she carved a 300-ton tweet in stone that says:

“I was here.
I ruled.
And I will be remembered.”

And 3,500 years later?

We still are.
