You’re standing in the desert.
To your left: the towering pyramids of Giza.
To your right: a creature.
Half lion. Half human. All drama.
It’s staring at you.
Calm. Silent. Like it knows something you don’t.
Welcome to the Great Sphinx of Giza — ancient Egypt’s most famous riddle with no answer.

Now first question:
What is a sphinx?

Well, in ancient Egypt, the sphinx was a mythical creature — body of a lion (for strength), head of a human (for wisdom).
Kind of like saying: “If you mess with me, I’ll outthink you and outrun you.”
Basically, the pharaoh’s spirit animal.

And this one — the Great Sphinx — is the largest and oldest known monolithic statue in the world.
Yes. Carved from a single block of limestone.
It’s 73 meters long. 20 meters tall. That’s like a 6-story building lying down and giving you the silent treatment.

So… who built it?

Ah. The first mystery.

Most Egyptologists say it was built during the reign of Khafre, the pharaoh behind the second pyramid at Giza, around 2500 BCE.
Why? Because the Sphinx sits right next to Khafre’s pyramid.
And there's a temple in front of it — also linked to him.
Makes sense, right?

But not everyone agrees.
Some researchers point to erosion patterns and say:
“Wait… this statue might be way older than we think. Maybe 7,000 years old.”
That’s called the water erosion hypothesis — and while it’s debated, it adds to the Sphinx’s reputation as the Mona Lisa of historical mysteries.

Oh — and speaking of mysteries…

Where’s the nose?

It’s gone. Just — vanished.
And no, Napoleon’s soldiers didn’t shoot it off with a cannon. That’s a myth.
Historical sketches from before Napoleon show the nose was already missing.

Most likely, it was deliberately chiseled off sometime between the 14th and 15th centuries by religious fanatics who didn’t like people worshipping stone statues.
So yes — centuries of majesty, wiped out by one angry dude with a hammer.

Let’s talk symbolism.
The Sphinx wasn’t just decoration. It was a guardian.
It watched over the pyramids, protected sacred grounds, and possibly represented the power of the sun god Ra.
Silent. Strong. Eternal.
Like a cosmic bouncer at the gate of the afterlife.

And here’s the real twist:
We still don’t know what’s inside it.

There have been radar scans, tunnels explored, and rumors of secret chambers beneath the Sphinx.
So far? Nothing confirmed.
But that hasn’t stopped the theories:
Lost libraries. Alien technology. Atlantis.

But you know what’s even cooler than myths?
The fact that humans, 4,500 years ago, carved this masterpiece with hammers, chisels, and imagination — and it’s still here.
Still standing.
Still making people say:
“Wait… how?”

So next time someone gives you that mysterious look, remember:
The Sphinx has been giving that same look for thousands of years.
And guess what?

It hasn’t blinked once.
